Data science:

Types of variables: 
  - Numerical: can take a wide variety of values, can do mathematical operations on. Can be continuous or discrete.
  - Categorical: can be split into levels. Ordinal: order matters, Nominal: no special ordering.
  * look at types of variables to get a good idea of data you're working with

**Statistics:**
Scientists seek to answer questions using rigorous methods and careful observations. These
observations – collected from the likes of field notes, surveys, and experiments – form the
backbone of a statistical investigation and are called data. Statistics is the study of how
best to collect, analyze, and draw conclusions from data. It is helpful to put statistics in
the context of a general process of investigation:
1. Identify a question or problem.
2. Collect relevant data on the topic.
3. Analyze the data.
4. Form a conclusion.

Statistics as a subject focuses on making stages 2-4 objective, rigorous, and e
cient.
That is, statistics has three primary components: How best can we collect data? How
should it be analyzed? And what can we infer from the analysis?
